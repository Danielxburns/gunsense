*This application was started as an entry for DeveloperWeek 2023 Hackathon. Presentation video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO4aICMYYWs)

I have continued working on the application afterwards as follows:
  - created project on Firebase
  - set up authentication and created Firestore DB for users 
  - created utility functions to sign up, sign in, and sign out users and connected them to relevant components
  - created request to fetch user's gov't representatives from Google Civic Information API
  - reshaped response data and displayed in list of representative cards
  - set up hosting on Firebase with custom domain [https://gunsense.danielburns.info/](https://gunsense.danielburns.info/)
